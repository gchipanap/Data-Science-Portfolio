# Data Science Projects

## Projects
1. [Citibike Visualization Tool](https://github.com/gchipanap/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/CitiBike_VisualizationTool)
   - **Description:** It is a visualization tool that contains interactive graphics that allows time filter input, contains different time granularities, such as yearly, monthly, daily, and weekly, as the demand for the use of Citibike system bicycles contains patterns according to these times.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python Virtual Environment, HTML, Sankey visualization, heatmaps, Google Maps API, Time series visualization
   - **Results:** Information about bike demand at different times of the day, week, and month can be extracted.
  
2. [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/gchipanap/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/House%20Price%20Prediction)
   - **Description:** This data science project aims to forecast housing prices utilizing a dataset comprising diverse features and attributes associated with residential properties. Through data analysis and modeling, the project endeavors to construct a predictive model capable of accurately estimating the selling prices of houses.
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Random Forest Regressor with sklearn
   - **Results:** The Forest Regressor model was the best among the models used, with an accuracy of 87.98%.
3. [Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis]([https://github.com/gchipanap/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/House%20Price%20Prediction](https://github.com/gchipanap/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Titanic%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis))
   - **Description:** The exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset is performed, where the first objective is to identify the characteristics that increased a passenger's chances of survival. It studies the demographics of the passengers (such as age, class, cabin, etc.).
   - **Technologies Used:** For predicting survivors, logistic regression notebooks are used, and Power BI is employed for EDA.
   - **Results:** It is confirmed that indeed there are higher chances of survival if the passenger is female or a child, if they paid more for their ticket (1st/2nd class), and if they have any acquaintances on board.
4. [Crop Yield Prediction](https://github.com/gchipanap/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Crop%20Yield%20Prediction)
   - **Description:** In this project, the prediction of crop yield is carried out, involving data preprocessing and studying the relationships between the data.
   - **Technologies Used:** Notebooks with Random Forest Regressor, AdaBoostRegressor, and GradientBoostingRegressor are utilized.
   - **Results:** The most relevant feature affecting crop yield is rainfall, and based on this data, it was found that GradientBoostingRegressor performed the best in prediction.
